                Hanoi, Vietnam.
                With a burning passion for theatrical arts and orchestral music, we - the producing team - strive to
                bring a novel, exhilarating, and humanistic experience to Vietnamese audiences.
                <br><br>
                This year, both the general director and music director of G'LAMS: "Ngay Do Bong Trang (Midday Moon)" are me.

                    reach,
                    an old
                    village existed under rules of Werewolf Board-game. Each person there, other than being
                    their-original-selves, was destined to play a role in the game.
                    <br><br>
                    Harry, the beautiful, jobless protagonist, woke up from a coma, losing half of his memories.
                    Walking out the square after one month, hearing the villagers fussing about “moon” “month” “wolf”
                    “death”, Harry didn’t get a thing.
                    <br><br>
                    On his way back home, a strange door showed up with the sign WONDERLAND. A hunch urged Harry to walk
                    through that door.</p>

                    friend.
                    <br><br>
                    Alice helped Harry recall his memories of the Werewolf rules:
                    <br><br>
                    01. It happens once a month, when the moon is full. The next noon is the execution hours.
                    <br><br>
                    02. The wolves kill one person each full-moon night, two at blood-moon night.
                    <br><br>
                    03. There are eight characters left who can decide the outcome, and two wolves hiding in between:
                    <br><br>
                    Gotham – the mayor
                    <br>
                    May – the healer
                    <br>
                    Richman – the landlord
                    <br>
                    Roxie – the candy dealer
                    <br>
                    Layla – the weaver
                    <br>
                    Bonnie – the shepherdess
                    <br>
                    Alice – the bartender
                    <br>
                    Harry – the unemployed
                    <br><br>
                    04. No one can escape. The only way out is to kill all the wolves before they eat us all.
                    <br><br>
                    05. Harry’s role, in case he forgot it as well, was the Normal Villager – totally useless!</p>

                    They met auntie May on a rush to pick the wormwood – the leaves believed to heal wolf-bites. Harry,

                    Meanwhile, the villagers and Layla were gossiping about Richman, who the whole village conceded as

                    <br><br>

                    He had to come up with a plan – an early move to help him win the game sooner.
                    <br>
                    “The Witch – poison – liquid – wine – Alice in Wonderland!”
                    <br><br>
                    With that outstanding deduction, Richman rushed back to the bar and compelled Alice to use up her
                    killing and healing potions on Roxie and Harry with his tempting reasons.

                    Roxie was the real Witch, and she despised the villagers because of their selfishness.

                    <br><br>
                    After a while, Harry admitted that he witnessed something the night Richman died in Wonderland:
                    Layla and
                    Bonnie were there, and Bonnie was trying to find a dubious thing in Richman’s body.

                    What a proof!

                    The Couple jumped to a conclusion: the shepherdess is a wolf.

                    Suddenly, Alice arrived: “Bonnie was attacked by the wolf... But auntie May helped heal and brought

                    <br><br>
                    3 A.M. Bonnie noticed Harry coming from distance, her face blushed then brightened.
                    <br>
                    She confessed to him, about her memorabilia locked at Richman’s when he was living, about how she
                    was healed, and about her special admiration for Harry.
                    <br>
                    In the story, an unprecedented name popped up: ‘Forest Wolf leaf’ – clearly written on a potion in
                    May’s house.
                    <br><br>
                    Out of nowhere, there was Gotham sitting on the veranda, smoking a pipe, and watching the young.
                    <br>
                    Then, the old man handed Harry a book named “1001 exclusive herbs for Wolves.” Afterwards, Harry
                    might have realized the answer he was chasing.
                    <br><br>
                    When Harry was gone, Bonnie’s smile dimmed. She went back to her dream, her unrequited love for him.

                    <br>
                    When Harry ran back home, Bonnie welcomed him. A knife in her right hand, a rope tying Roxie in her
                    left hand.
                    <br>
                    Bonnie was the Cursed Wolf – May put the curse on her.
                    <br><br>
                    At that moment, Bonnie exposed every secret that all the villagers – including Roxie and Alice – had
                    been hiding from Harry.
                    <br>
                    That Harry was the Prince, who had double lives, who was destined to bring peace to the Village, and
                    who was hung on the noose once by the villagers he always trusted. Therefore, May was never his
                    savior: his role saved him.
                    <br>
                    That Harry and Bonnie were lovers, which he completely forgot after the coma. And Bonnie’s half-moon
                    necklace was Harry’s gift.
                    <br>
                    That Bonnie never bore a thought about the wolves’ plan, for all she wanted was Harry’s love.
                    <br><br>
                    But Harry didn’t relent, though his heart was heavily wounded by his most sacred ideal.
                    <br><br>
                    “Then let me make you feel how I felt.”
                    <br><br>
                    Bonnie was about to kill Roxie when Alice arrived: “They are linked by the
                    Cupid. If Roxie dies, so does Harry.”
                    <br><br>
                    Bonnie stopped, bursting out her most painful laugh: “Turns out it was all a play you damned people
                    created. And I am the only one who was betrayed.”
                    <br>
                    “All too well! Please bask in your triumph, your despicable triumph.”
